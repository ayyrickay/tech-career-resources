## Meetups

[San Francisco UX Design](http://www.meetup.com/sanfranciscouxd/)
Haven't been yet.

[Cascade SF](http://www.meetup.com/cascadesf/)
They basically bring in dozens of mentors who just talk to you about Design/Development and getting a career in the field. It's positive and supportive, and they have a speaker who usually talks about something pretty interesting. The biggest recommendation: Prioritize going for the mentor nights.

[Autodesk Design Night](http://www.autodesk.com/gallery/design-nights)
Probably the most college-student oriented set of events (and they have one tomorrow!) Autodesk is the company that makes tools like Maya - they're pretty cool and cutting edge, especially with IoT (Internet of Things) on the horizon, so they're worth checking out - bring friends, though. It makes the event less intimidating, since they don't really facilitate networking.

[UX Eye](http://www.meetup.com/sfbayux/)
This is run by a company called EchoUser that's pretty sweet. They're a UX Design agency, and they work with clients like Google, and... I want to say Capital One? I don't know. Lots of great ideas coming out of here, but it might be a little overwhelming, just glancing at their topics. They're a little more intermediate-advanced, but I think it can be cool if you want to just dive in.

[Action Design](http://www.meetup.com/Action-Design-SF/)
Haven't been yet, but the topics look pretty solid.
